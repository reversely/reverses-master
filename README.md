### Font

The theme includes a version of [EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond), designed by Georg Duffner and Octavio Pardo. It's the closest alternative I could come up with that included an open license to include with the theme.

A [copy of the license](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/blob/master/assets/fonts/OFL.txt) has been included in the `assets` folder and must be included with any distributions of this theme that include the EB Garamond font files.
