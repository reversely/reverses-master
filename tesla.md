<h3>Re:verses hosts conversations with thinkers about the processes that drive their work.</h3><br>

As a journalist, I have had the pleasure of writing about some of the most incredible people in the world. But I've realized that the unfiltered conversations I've had tell much more about these people than an edited story can.

Leaving out insights that didn’t fit into the broader arc of a profile has always been difficult for me. It’s one thing to kill your own darlings; another to pare another person’s words down in service of a narrative. This site is my answer to that struggle. Here, I’ve posted a full archive of conversations I've had while writing articles and interviews for the <em>Taipei Times, Ploughshares</em> and other publications.

It's also a new personal project where I document new long-form conversations with authors and thinkers about the hopes, fears, and beliefs that underlie what they do. I hope you enjoy hearing their stories, in their own voices as much as I have. I’m so excited to continue sharing these revelatory and inspiring voices with you. <br> <br>
